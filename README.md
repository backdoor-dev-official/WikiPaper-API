 At the moment it is still in work in progress but the server is close to 90% ready for now it is quite simple and still in development but I saw the need to make use of a client because I am having some bugs but I am working on it for now it works quite well but the latest bugs are solved I am going to add version 1.0 and I will try to prepare the public servant.

Some changes were made and errors were fixed. It should be usable with curl and the client would not be required. I am working on resolving a final error with file upload and after that, file lists would be available. The request of file content and file upload are already done, but there are some security issues that are being worked on. They are actually done, but there are some errors that are being resolved. It may be ready in a week, at most in one day.
