 At the moment it is still in work in progress but the server is close to 90% ready for now it is quite simple and still in development but I saw the need to make use of a client because I am having some bugs but I am working on it for now it works quite well but the latest bugs are solved I am going to add version 1.0 and I will try to prepare the public servant.

 Some changes were made and errors were fixed. It should be usable with curl and the client would not be required. I am working on resolving a final error with file upload and after that, file lists would be available. The request of file content and file upload are already done, but there are some security issues that are being worked on. They are actually done, but there are some errors that are being resolved. It may be ready in a week, at most in one day.

 The basic logic of the server is 100% complete. The public server will be ready from tomorrow at around 5pm. I will start working on creating documentation now, so you can learn how to implement it in your code if you want. You must give credit if you do. The main functions will be revealed. Binaries will be made for both Windows and Linux, but it will take a little longer for Linux because I don't know how to compile for Linux yet. I'm going to try to learn. After finishing the documentation, I will work on a graphical client. I plan to try to learn Flutter or something similar to bring an app to Android as well. That's all the update for now. I plan to add a roadmap soon. It's quite possible that it will also be when the public server opens at around 1am. I will post a place where you can share your ideas for adding to the API. Please keep in mind that this is my first major project and I am also a high school junior. Please be patient. I would like to inform you that this is Argentina time. I plan to create a Discord server where you can interact with me. Thank you for your time.
